This repository is made to showcase the comprehensive Macroeconomic research project undertaken by the author to examine the impact 
of Financial structure of a country on its GDP growth. We used robust regression models to effectively quantify the impact on 
the gdp growth of several countries sorted based on their income-per-capita and found that lower income countries can benefit more 
from a higher degree of financial infastructure and access in order to boom their growth. This is in-line with existing literature 
discussed comprehensively in the paper. Our contribution with this paper is to reexamine the preexisting economic theories and imperical 
studies using comprehensive new data(2016).
