Macroeconomic research project on the impact of Financial structure of a country on its GDP growth. I made a robust regression models to effectively quantify how much will a country's GDP growth rate( as a proxy for growth of a country) is influenced by the sophistication of their Financial structure.
We grouped the countries based on income( variable; income-per-capita) and found that higher degree of financial infastructure will
lead to a higher growth in lower income countries than their more developed counterparts as access, liquidity, stability and trust in their financial systems 
will lead to higher degrees of foreign investment, entrepreneurship activities and other unexamined factors that boaster this GDP growth opportunity. 

discussed comprehensively in the paper. Our contribution to reexamine the preexisting economic theories and imperical 
studies using comprehensive new data(2016, WorldBank) on 68 countries.
